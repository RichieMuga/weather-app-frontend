# WeatherApp Frontend

## Introduction
- This is a Next.js-based weather application frontend, providing users with real-time weather data and forecasts. Explore the Git repository for more insights.

## Motivation
I was motivated by the need to create a responsive and intuitive weather application that seamlessly integrates with a Laravel backend API. The project focuses on delivering accurate weather information through an accessible interface while demonstrating modern frontend.

## API Integration
The frontend connects to a Laravel backend API for weather data processing and storage. Configuration details can be found in the .env.local.example file.
